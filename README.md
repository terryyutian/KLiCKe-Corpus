# The Keystroke Logging in Compositions for Knowledge Evaluation (KLiCKe) Corpus

The Keystroke Logging in Compositions for Knowledge Evaluation (KLiCKe) corpus is a large-scale dataset featuring detailed keystroke logs for the writing process. This corpus comprises ~5,000 persuasive essays written by adult writers in the United States. Details of the writers' text production processes, including every keystroke and mouse operation with the corresponding time stamps and cursor position information, were recorded using a web-based keystroke logging program and were presented in _.csv_ (for custom data manipulation and analysis) and _.idfx_ (analyzable by available keystroke logging software like [Inputlog](https://www.inputlog.net/)) formats. Holistic writing quality scores are also available for all the persuasive texts in the corpus, obtained through double-blind rating by a cohort of expert human raters using a standardized essay grading scale. In addition, the corpus also provides the writers' demographic information such as age, gender, native language, ethnicity/race, and education level, as well as information about their keyboarding skills and vocabulary knowledge.

Here is a list of items this repository provides:

- Writing Task folder. This folder contains the ~5,000 persuasive texts, the corresponding keystroke logs in both _.csv_ and _.idfx_ format, and the holistic scores of these texts.
- Typing Tests folder. This folder contains the results from four typing tests, represented in keystroke logs in both in both _.csv_ and _.idfx_ format.
- Vocabulary Knowledge Test folder. This folder contains the results from the vocabulary knowledge test.
- Demographic Information. This spreadsheet contains the writers' demographic details.
